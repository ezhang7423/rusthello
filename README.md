# learning rust

## notes

Cargo is awesome. Compiler catches a lot of errors as well ahead of time. Vscode formatter is great too. But the analyzer could use a lot of work. Erros that will be returned by the compiler are not always caught by the analyzer, and there is no code jumping. Both of these are pretty essential. Language itself is awesome. Fast, safe, and pretty fun.
